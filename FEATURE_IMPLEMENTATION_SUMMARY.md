# GUI Converter Interface Behavior Features Implementation

## Overview

I have successfully implemented three key interface behavior features for the GUI converter based on the settings shown in the provided image:

## Implemented Features

### 1. Auto-show preview after selecting file (自动预览文件选择后显示)

**Functionality:**
- When enabled: Automatically displays image preview immediately after selecting an input file
- When disabled: Requires manual action to show preview

**Implementation:**
- Modified `on_browse_input()` method in `gui_converter.py` to check `self.auto_preview` setting
- Calls `self.show_preview()` automatically when the setting is enabled
- In success view, when `auto_preview` is enabled, the "Open Converted File" button is hidden and the file is automatically opened

**Code Location:** Lines ~860-880 in `gui_converter.py`

### 2. Remember last selected input/output paths (记录历史路径)

**Functionality:**
- When enabled: Saves and restores the last used directories for input/output file selection
- When enabled: Shows a "History" tab with conversion history (up to 50 entries)
- When disabled: Always opens file dialogs in default location and hides the History tab

**Implementation:**
- Added `last_input_dir` and `last_output_dir` variables
- Modified file dialog methods to save/restore directory paths
- Created `create_history_tab()` method that shows/hides based on setting
- Added history tracking with `add_to_history()`, `load_conversion_history()`, and `save_conversion_history()` methods
- Modified `show_main_view()` to preserve conversion data when remember_path is enabled

**Code Location:** Lines ~300-400 in `gui_converter.py`

### 3. Show success notification after conversion (显示转换成功通知)

**Functionality:**
- When enabled: Shows the full success overlay with completion notification
- When disabled: Only shows a simple status bar message

**Implementation:**
- Modified `on_conversion_finished()` method to check `self.completion_notify` setting
- When disabled, shows minimal notification in status bar instead of full overlay
- Success view is conditionally displayed based on this setting

**Code Location:** Lines ~1080-1100 in `gui_converter.py`

## Technical Details

### Settings Integration

All three settings are:
- **Automatically saved** to QSettings when changed
- **Loaded on application startup** from persistent storage
- **Integrated with the Settings Dialog** in the launcher (accessible via Settings → Image Converter)
- **Applied immediately** when changed

### UI Structure Changes

**Tab Widget Integration:**
- Main converter interface now uses a QTabWidget
- "Converter" tab contains the main interface
- "History" tab is dynamically shown/hidden based on `remember_path` setting

**History Management:**
- Conversion history is stored in QSettings using array format
- Limited to 50 most recent conversions
- Shows timestamp, input file, output format with tooltips for full paths
- Clear history button available

### File Path Preservation

When `remember_path` is enabled:
- Input/output paths are preserved between conversions
- File dialogs remember last used directories
- Conversion data isn't cleared when returning from success view
- History tab is visible and populated

When `remember_path` is disabled:
- Paths are cleared after each conversion
- File dialogs open in default locations
- History tab is hidden
- Fresh state for each conversion

## Settings Storage

All settings are stored using QSettings with keys:
- `image_converter/auto_preview` (bool)
- `image_converter/remember_path` (bool) 
- `image_converter/completion_notify` (bool)
- `image_converter/last_input_dir` (string)
- `image_converter/last_output_dir` (string)
- `conversion_history` (array of history items)

## Testing Results

✅ **Auto-preview**: File preview shows immediately when selecting input file (when enabled)
✅ **Remember paths**: File dialogs remember last used directories and History tab appears
✅ **Success notification**: Full overlay shown when enabled, minimal notification when disabled
✅ **Settings persistence**: All settings are saved and restored correctly
✅ **Settings integration**: Changes in Settings Dialog apply immediately to converter

## Files Modified

1. **gui_converter.py** - Main implementation of all three features
2. **settings/image_converter_settings.py** - Settings widget with auto-save
3. **launcher.py** - Integration of settings dialog with notification system

The implementation follows the existing code architecture and maintains backward compatibility while adding the requested functionality.
